        <h1>About Heart Disease</h1>
        <h3>What is heart disease?</h3>
        <p>
            The term "heart disease" refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common type of heart disease in the United States is coronary artery disease (CAD), which affects the blood flow to the heart. Decreased blood flow can cause a heart attack.
        </p>
        <h3>What are the symptoms of heart disease?</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes heart disease may be "silent" and not diagnosed until a person experiences signs or symptoms of a heart attack, heart failure, or an arrhythmia. When these events happen, symptoms may include

<ol>* Heart attack: Chest pain or discomfort, upper back or neck pain, indigestion, heartburn, nausea or vomiting, extreme fatigue, upper body discomfort, dizziness, and shortness of breath.</ol>
<ol>* Arrhythmia: Fluttering feelings in the chest (palpitations).</ol>
<ol>* Heart failure: Shortness of breath, fatigue, or swelling of the feet, ankles, legs, abdomen, or neck veins.</ol>
        </p>
        <h3>What are the risk factors for heart disease?</h3>
        <p>
            High blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. About half of people in the United States (47%) have at least one of these three risk factors.2 Several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease, including

            <ol>* Diabetes</ol>
            <ol>* Overweight and obesity</ol>
            <ol>* Unhealthy diet</ol>
            <ol>* Physical inactivity</ol>
            <ol>* Excessive alcohol use</ol>
        </p>
        <h3>When to see a doctor?</h3>
        <p>Seek emergency medical care if you have these heart disease symptoms:

            <ol>* Chest pain</ol>
            <ol>* Shortness of breath</ol>
            <ol>* Fainting</ol>
            Always call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack.<br><br>
            
            Heart disease is easier to treat when detected early. Talk to your health care provider if you have any concerns about your heart health. Together, you and your provider can discuss ways to reduce your heart disease risk. This is especially important if you have a family history of heart disease.</p>
